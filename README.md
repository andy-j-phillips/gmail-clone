# Gmail Clone

## Getting started

For installation:-
```bash
npm install
```

The below command will run both the mock server and the React app.
```bash
npm run develop
```

If you are having trouble running the above, you can run the below two commands on separate processes:-
```bash
npm run mock-server
```

```bash
npm start
```

The application will then be available [here](http://localhost:3000/).
